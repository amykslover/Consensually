The next version of this application will include the option to create two other codes, an "Assist" code and an "Emergency" code. The assist code will send a message to a previously set up group of friends when entered during an encounter and the emergency will send a message to the police with the user's location. Each one of these codes will show up on the user interface as a valid code, so the other participant will not be aware the user has requested assistance.

# Create New Encounter
One of the partners will create an encounter from their account and then look up their partner by entering in a code. Both users will be prompted to enter their four digit pin and will be given 3 attempts before being notified that they may not be able to consent at this time.

The next version of this application will require both users to have the application and a QR code will be created on the partners phone that will be scanned in to start the encounter. This is increase security by not allowing a user to randomly look up partners by their user identifier.

# View Encounter History
The encounter view is a history of the encounters a user has either created or in which they were a partner. This view currently only will work for the user who created the encounter and the application will be updated to add a partner to the table and allow a partner view of the encounter.
